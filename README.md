This One is our entry for the Ludum Dare 26 Jam. Ludum Dare Jam is a three-times-annual online game jam, where teams create games in 72 hours or less. Games must be created according to a theme announced at the beginning of the project, and entries are judged on various criteria.

The theme for Ludum Dare 26 was "Minimalism". Our original idea was to take a different spin on minimalism; we interpreted this as a regression to minimalism instead of a minimalistic game. The gameplay becomes simpler over time, which is tied together with a overarching narrative - originally designed to be tragic, but that ending was cut :(
